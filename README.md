# Laptop Page
A fully responsive landing page made using the Materialize CSS framework along with HTML and javascript. 
Some nice features are:
-a custom logo that I made.
-the use of intersectional observer to change both the nav bar's and a floating action button's styles after scrolling into and out of the hero section. 
-the mobile version of the Specification section which makes use of a sticky header on the comparison table.
